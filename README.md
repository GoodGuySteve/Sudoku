# Sudoku
This is a toy project I've created for my own education and enjoyment. The goal is to create a
functional Sudoku generator and solver. These will be developed in parallel so that they can be
used to steadily improve one another. 

Eventually, I hope to be able to optimize these as far as I can and see both how easily I can create 
or solve difficult puzzles and how high I can scale the solutions. 

I chose Rust as my language of choice for this project because I needed a good excuse to use Rust.
Because I'm eventually going to want to utilize parallelism to improve this project, Rust may be a
good choice due to how easy it supposedly is to parallelize functional Rust code.
